  Generates single cell feature counts for a single library.

  Input parameters for Feature Barcode, Targeted Gene Expression and CRISPR-specific
  analyses are not implemented, therefore the correspondent outputs are also excluded.

  Parameters set by default:
  --disable-ui - no need in any UI when running in Docker container
  --id - can be hardcoded as we rename input files anyway
  --fastqs - points to the current directory, because input FASTQ files are staged there

  Why do we need to rename input files?
  Refer to the "My FASTQs are not named like any of the above examples" section of
  https://support.10xgenomics.com/single-cell-gene-expression/software/pipelines/latest/using/fastq-input
