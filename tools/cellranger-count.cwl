  Cell Ranger Count Gene Expression

  Quantifies gene expression from a single-cell RNA-Seq library.

  Input parameters for Feature Barcode, Targeted Gene
  Expression and CRISPR-specific analyses are not implemented,
  therefore the correspondent outputs are also excluded.

  Parameters set by default:
  --disable-ui - no need in any UI when running in Docker
    container
  --id - can be hardcoded as we rename input files anyway
  --fastqs - points to the current directory, because input
    FASTQ files are staged there

  Why do we need to rename input files?
  Refer to the "My FASTQs are not named like any of the above
  examples" section of
  https://support.10xgenomics.com/single-cell-gene-expression/software/pipelines/latest/using/fastq-input
